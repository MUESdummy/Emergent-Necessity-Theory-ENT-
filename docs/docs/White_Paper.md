## Abstract
Emergent Necessity Theory (ENT) asserts that whenever an information
network’s internal constraints close above a critical
**modal-tightness threshold** (τ > τ_c), the system must descend onto a
low-entropy attractor. Order is therefore *mandatory*, not a lucky
break. We integrate concepts from quantum foundations, complexity
science, and cognitive neuroscience to argue that ENT explains why
consciousness, biological complexity, and large-scale social
regularities arise reliably in our universe.

To operationalise this claim for volitional human behaviour we define
the **Meta-Universal Equality Scale (MUES)**, a purely descriptive
ledger that sums intention-weighted impacts once an agent crosses a
well-specified awareness threshold (Θ₁–Θ₃). All moral language is
stripped; MUES measures informational influence, not virtue. Four
latent kernels—autonomy α, ego-resistance β, epochal knowledge C(t),
and hardship-load H(t)—are left as open empirical problems, forming the
basis of an open-collaboration scientific challenge.

## 1 Introduction
Scientific narratives oscillate between **chance** (random mutation,
measurement collapse) and **law** (conservation, symmetry, curvature).
ENT takes a third road: *structural necessity*. Once a network of
relations becomes self-supporting, macroscopic outcomes are
non-contingent. From that angle, apparent randomness is merely a
projection—sub-networks lacking full information of the closure above
them.

We begin by formalising that idea via **modal tightness** (§2), then
derive an entropy-ordering theorem linking τ to global state-space
reduction (Yellow Paper, Theorem 2). Section 3 introduces MUES, the
human-trajectory ledger compatible with ENT; Section 4 bridges ENT to
physics, AI, and evolutionary biology; Section 5 summarises simulation
evidence; Section 6 proposes an open challenge; Appendix A provides a
one-page glossary; references close the document.

## 2 Foundational Postulates

> **Postulate 1 (Closure Imperative).**  
> A system whose constraint graph forms a single strongly-connected
> component self-determines its macroscopic state set.

> **Postulate 2 (Entropy-Ordering).**  
> For two systems with identical local entropy budgets, the one with
> higher modal tightness τ exhibits lower joint entropy in its
> long-run distribution.

> **Postulate 3 (Experiential Volition).**  
> Agents embedded within such a system experience internal trajectory
> choice, though from the outside view those trajectories are fully
> determined by the closed structure.

### 2.1 Modal-Tightness τ

Let \(I(x_i;x_j)\) denote mutual information and \(H(x_i)\) the entropy
of variable \(x_i\). Define

\[
\tau \;=\;
\max_{i<j} \frac{I(x_i;x_j)}{H(x_i)+\varepsilon},
\qquad
\varepsilon = 10^{-8}.
\tag{1}
\]

τ ≈ 1 signals at least one near-deterministic link; τ ≈ 0 marks
independence. The **critical threshold τ_c** depends on topology; for
random Boolean networks τ_c ≈ 0.35 replicates the chaotic–ordered phase
transition (see Yellow Paper §5.1).

### 2.2 Entropy-Ordering Lemma

For any finite system \(S\) with microstate space \(\Omega\) and modal
tightness \(\tau\), let \(H_{\infty}(S)\) denote the Shannon entropy of
its stationary distribution.  Then

\[
\tau_a > \tau_b \quad\Longrightarrow\quad
H_{\infty}(S_a) < H_{\infty}(S_b).
\tag{2}
\]

*Proof sketch.*  Construct a coarse-graining map \(\pi\colon\Omega\to
\mathcal{M}\) whose fibres respect the strongest mutual-information
links.  Show that increasing \(\tau\) shrinks the image of \(\pi\), then
apply Fano’s inequality on conditional entropy.  (Full proof in Yellow
Paper §2.)

## 3 Operational Layer → MUES

We require a scale that (i) activates only after an
*awareness threshold* is crossed, (ii) remains language-agnostic, and
(iii) sums contributions without moral qualifiers.  MUES satisfies all
three.

### 3.1 Activation thresholds Θ₁–Θ₃  
* Θ₁ Self-model emergence (mirror test analogue)  
* Θ₂ Counterfactual empathy (second-order ToM)  
* Θ₃ Modal-tightness reflection (agent can reason about own constraints)

Only after Θ₃ may an agent’s trajectory be logged in MUES.

### 3.2 Kernel definition

We decompose the kernel into five latent factors:

| Symbol | Interpretation | Range |
|--------|----------------|-------|
| \(α_{ik}\) | Autonomy (structural freedom) | \([0,1]\) |
| \(β_{ik}\) | Ego-resistance | \([0,\infty)\) |
| \(C(t_k)\) | Epochal knowledge access | \([0,\infty)\) |
| \(H_{ik}(t)\) | Hardship-Load coefficient | \([1,\infty)\) |
| \(I_{ik},\,G_{ik}\) | Intent magnitude & achieved gain | \(\mathbb{R}\) |

The provisional kernel is

\[
Q_{ik}=β_{ik}\,α_{ik}\,H_{ik}(t_k)\,C(t_k)\,I_{ik}\,G_{ik}.
\tag{3}
\]

The Hardship-Load patch (v0.3) ensures agents facing extreme external
constraints are not penalised for absolute outcomes beyond their
control; see Yellow Paper §B.1.

### 3.3 Ledger aggregation

Total MUES impact for agent \(i\) up to time \(T\) is

\[
\mathrm{MUES}_i(T)=\sum_{t_k<T} Q_{ik}.
\tag{4}
\]

No “pass/fail” threshold is imposed.  ENT predicts only that the
distribution of \(\mathrm{MUES}_i\) values in sufficiently closed
societies converges toward symmetry about 0 under long-time zoom-out.

## 4 Cross-Disciplinary Bridges

* **Quantum foundations.**  Modal tightness parallels constraint
  closure in consistent-histories formulations.  
* **Evolutionary biology.**  τ tracks criticality in RBN models of gene
  regulation (Kauffman, 1993).  
* **AI alignment.**  MUES acts as a sparsity-aware reward aggregator,
  avoiding single-objective collapse.

*(expanded examples follow in subsections 4.1–4.3)*

## 5 Empirical Hints

> **Simulation suite highlights** (full plots in Yellow Paper):
>
> * RBN: modal-tightness vs frozen-component size (N = 10⁴, k = 2).  
> * Autocatalytic chem-nets: τ predicts survival probability under
>   energetic shocks.  
> * Evolutionary Prisoner’s-Dilemma: τ > 0.4 ↔ cooperation plateau.  
> * ICEWS event stream (1995-2018): rolling-window τ dips precede
>   regime-change events by ≈ 170 days (σ = 25).
