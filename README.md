## 1  What is Emergent Necessity Theory (ENT)?

Emergent Necessity Theory asserts that whenever an information network’s internal constraints
cross a critical **modal-tightness** threshold (τ > τ_c), the system must
descend into a low-entropy attractor.  
Order is therefore *mandatory,* not a lucky break.  
We combine concepts from quantum foundations, complexity science and
cognitive neuroscience to explain why consciousness, biological
complexity and large-scale social regularities arise reliably in our universe.

### 1.1  MUES (Meta-Universal Equality Scale)  [https://github.com/MUESdummy/Meta-Universal-Equality-Scale.git]

MUES is a purely descriptive ledger that sums intention-weighted impacts
once an agent crosses a self-awareness threshold (θ > θ̂).  
All moral language is stripped; MUES measures informational influence,
not virtue.

#### Roadmap (v0.9.0 ► v1.0.0 targets)

1- Finish full human-subject sensitivity analysis (in progress)     
2- Replace placeholder τ derivation with lab data     
3- Add quantum-holozie ϵ calculation     
4- Peer-review DOI via OSF preregistration     
5- Community: open issues & accept PRs for critique/replication     
 

#### Contributing

1- Fork the repo, create a branch (feat/… or fix/…).     
2- Ensure pre-commit run --all-files passes (Markdown lint + spell-check).     
3- Open a pull-request — one of the maintainers will review.     
4- Code of conduct: be rigorous, be kind.
