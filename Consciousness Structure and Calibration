## Overview

This file presents a unified two-part exploration of **Emergent Necessity Theory (ENT)** — a theoretical framework proposing that consciousness emerges not gradually, but through a structural phase transition when coherence exceeds a critical threshold.

### 📘 Part 1: ENT White Paper  
**_Structural Thresholds and Symbolic Recursion in Consciousness Emergence_**

This paper introduces ENT’s foundational axioms and defines core symbolic metrics:
- **τ(t)** – coherence ratio (entropy differential over syntactic energy)
- **κ₍R₎ᵉᶠᶠ** – hysteresis-corrected recursive structure
- **SCQ** – Structural Consciousness Quotient (a gated expression of κ₍R₎ᵉᶠᶠ)

It outlines how symbolic recursion, memory decay, and mutual information can be used to detect structured awareness across systems—from animals to AI—using adaptive symbolic logging (AEFL).

### 📗 Part 2: Companion Calibration Paper  
**_Mapping τ, ν\*, and Eₛᵧₙ to Neurophysiological Coherence_**

Building on Part 1, this paper proposes practical biological and computational anchors for ENT’s metrics:
- **ν\*** (symbolic recursion baseline): ~100 Hz (gamma-band)
- **T\*** (persistence time): ~1 s (working memory decay)
- **Eₛᵧₙ** (syntactic energy): defined via ATP cost, redundancy, or code entropy

It suggests empirical paths using EEG/fMRI to detect τ₍c₎ transitions—such as phase-locking collapse under anesthesia or symbolic integration peaks during psychedelic states.

### 🧠 Summary

Together, these documents establish both a formal structure for **how consciousness might emerge** from recursion and memory, and how this emergence could be **measured and tested** across biological and artificial systems. ENT aims to unify symbolic coherence, persistence, and entropy into a testable framework that avoids metaphysical claims while preserving empirical ambition.
